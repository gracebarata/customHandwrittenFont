          “Wherever I am, there’s always Pooh,<br />
          There’s always Pooh and Me.<br />
          Whatever I do, he wants to do,<br />
          “Where are you going today?” says Pooh:<br />
          “Well, that’s very odd ‘cos I was too.<br />
          Let’s go together,” says Pooh, says he.<br />

          <!-- “All men have stars, <br />
          but they are not the same things for different people.<br />
          For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. <br />
          For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. <br />
          For others, who are scholars, they are problems... <br />
          But all these stars are silent.<br /> -->
          "You-You alone will have stars as no one else has them... <br />
          In one of the stars I shall be living. <br />
          In one of them I shall be laughing. <br />
          And so it will be as if all the stars will be laughing<br />
          when you look at the sky at night..<br />
          You, only you, will have stars that can laugh! <br />
          And when your sorrow is comforted <br />
          you will be content that you have known me... <br />
          You will always be my friend." <br />
